# bit, bit (unit)
This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Unit Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2.0/independent/1948/information/bit`](https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2.0/independent/1948/information/bit)**  
**Definition name:** `bit`

**Unit name:** bit  
**Latin symbol:** bit  
**Display symbol:** bit  
  
**Description:** A basic unit of digital information representing a single logical state with one of two possible values, defined by Shannon in 1948.

"If the base 2 is used the resulting units may be called binary digits, or more briefly bits, a word suggested by J. W. Tukey. A device with two stable positions, such as a relay or a flip-flop circuit, can store one bit of information." ["A Mathematical Theory of Communication", C. E. Shannon, The Bell System Technical Journal 27, 379 (1948)].
