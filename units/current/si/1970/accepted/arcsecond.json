    "description": "A unit of plane and phase angle equal to 1/60 of an arcminute, which is 1/1296000 of a circle and equivalent to pi/648000 rad, with rad defined according to the 1960 supplementary SI unit.\n\nThis definition uses \"arcsecond\" as the unit name to distingush it from the time unit named minute.\nThe unit appear under the name second (with symbol \u2033) in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as \"1\u2033 = (1/60)\u2032 = (\u03c0/648 000) rad.\"\n\nThe International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as \"Units in use with the International Sytem.\"\nThe International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) adds as a footnote: \"ISO 31 recommends that the degree be subdivided decimally rather than using the minute and second.\"\nThe International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) further adds to that footnote: \"For navigation and surveying, however, the minute has the advantage that one minute of latitude on the surface of the Earth corresponds (approximately) to one nautical mile.\"\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) replaces the footnote with: \"For some applications such as in astronomy, small angles are measured in arcseconds (i.e. seconds of plane angle), denoted as or \u2032\u2032, or milliarcseconds, microarcseconds and picoarcseconds, denoted mas, \u03bcas and pas, respectively, where arcsecond is an alternative name for second of plane angle.\nThe formulation \"denoted as or \u2033\" is reproduced here faithfully from the source and suggests an alternate symbol may have been omitted due to a typographical error.\nIt is not clear what alternate symbol was intended to be referenced.",
