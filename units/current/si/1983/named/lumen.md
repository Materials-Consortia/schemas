# lumen, lm (unit)
This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Unit Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2.0/si/1983/named/lumen`](https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2.0/si/1983/named/lumen)**  
**Definition name:** `lumen`

**Unit name:** lumen  
**Latin symbol:** lm  
**Display symbol:** lm  
  
**Description:** A derived SI unit for luminous flux equal to cdÂ·sr using the 1983 SI units.

"The lumen is the luminous flux emitted in a steradian by a uniform point source with a luminous intensity of one candela." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

The lumen was defined at the 9th CGPM meeting in 1946, implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1, the redefinition of the candela at the 16th CGPM Meeting in 1979, resolution 3, and the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.
