    "description": "A unit used to express the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation defined as 10\u207b\u00b2 J/kg using the current, or one of the historical, definitions of the SI units.\n\nThis unit definition uses \"radiationunit\" as the symbol for this unit despite \"rad\" being in common use, to distiguish it from the radian, which is an SI unit with rad as its symbol.\n\nThe radiation unit appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as \"1 rad = 10\u207b\u00b2 J/kg\" with the footnote: \"The rad is a special unit employed to express absorbed dose of ionizing radiation. When there is risk of confusion with the symbol for radian, rd may be used as the symbol for rad.\"\n\nThe International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as \"Units in use temporarily with the International Sytem.\"\nThe International System of Units (SI), 3rd ed. (1977) changes the definition to use the unit gray: \"1 rad = cGy = 10\u207b\u00b2 Gy.\"\nThe International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorization to \"Examples of other non-SI units\" and adds the additional footnote: \"Note that this non-SI unit is exactly equivalent to an SI unit with an appropriate submultiple prefix.\"\nThe International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) omits the unit.\n\nThe roentgen was implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM meeting (1983), resolution 1.\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
