    "description": "A list of strings that flag which special features are used by the structure.\n\n**Requirements/Conventions:**\n\n- MUST be an empty list if no special features are used.\n- MUST be sorted alphabetically.\n- If a special feature listed below is used, the list MUST contain the corresponding string.\n- If a special feature listed below is not used, the list MUST NOT contain the corresponding string.\n- **List of strings used to indicate special structure features:**\n  - `disorder`: this flag MUST be present if any one entry in the species list has a `chemical_symbols` list that is longer than 1 element.\n  - `implicit_atoms`: this flag MUST be present if the structure contains atoms that are not assigned to sites via the property `species_at_sites` (e.g., because their positions are unknown). When this flag is present, the properties related to the chemical formula will likely not match the type and count of atoms represented by the `species_at_sites`, `species`, and `assemblies` properties.\n  - `site_attachments`: this flag MUST be present if any one entry in the species list includes `attached` and `nattached`.\n  - `assemblies`: this flag MUST be present if the property assemblies is present.\n\n  **Explained examples**:\n  - A structure having implicit atoms and using assemblies: `[\"assemblies\", \"implicit_atoms\"]`",
