    "description": "The chemical formula for a structure as a string in a form chosen by the API implementation.\n\n**Requirements/Conventions**:\n\n- The chemical formula is given as a string consisting of properly capitalized element symbols followed by integers or decimal numbers, balanced parentheses, square, and curly brackets `(`,\\ `)`, `[`,\\ `]`, `{`, `}`, commas, the `+`, `-`, `:` and `=` symbols.\n  The parentheses are allowed to be followed by a number.\n  Spaces are allowed anywhere except within chemical symbols.\n  The order of elements and any groupings indicated by parentheses or brackets are chosen freely by the API implementation.\n- The string SHOULD be arithmetically consistent with the element ratios in the `chemical_formula_reduced` property.\n- It is RECOMMENDED, but not mandatory, that symbols, parentheses and brackets, if used, are used with the meanings prescribed by [IUPAC's Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/bibliog/blue.html).\n\n**Query examples**:\n\n- Note: the free-form nature of this property is likely to make queries on it across different databases inconsistent.\n- A filter that matches an exactly given formula: `chemical_formula_descriptive=\"(H2O)2 Na\"`.\n- A filter that does a partial match: `chemical_formula_descriptive CONTAINS \"H2O\"`.",
