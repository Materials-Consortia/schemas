# SI 2019 (unitsystem)

This page documents an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) [Unitsystem Definition](https://schemas.optimade.org/#definitions). See [https://schemas.optimade.org/](https://schemas.optimade.org/) for more information.

**ID: [`https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/unitsystems/si/si_2019`](https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/unitsystems/si/si_2019.md)**  
**Definition name:** `si_2019`

**Unitsystem name:** SI 2019  
**Description:** The SI 2019 unit system as represented in the 9th edition (v1.06) of The International System of Units.

The International System of Units (SI) is established and maintained by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).
In the redefinition of the SI unit system in 2019 the magnitudes of all SI units are defined from declaring exact numerical values for seven defining constants when expressed in terms of their SI units.

The SI 2019 unit system represents the original publication of the 9th edition of the The International System of Units in march 2019 (marked v1.06).
The 9th edition was later updated in 2022 with new SI prefixes defined at the 27th CGPM meeting in 2022.
These prefixes are not included.

**Formats:** [[JSON](si_2019.json)] [[MD](si_2019.md)]

The steradian is the solid angle with its vertex at the center of a sphere with a radius of one meter, which cuts out an area of one square meter on the surface of that sphere.\"\n\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition give a rephrased but equivalent definition: \"The solid angle, expressed in steradian, corresponds to the ratio between an area \\(A\\) of the surface of a sphere of radius \\(r\\) and the squared radius, \\(\\Omega = A/r^2\\) sr. One steradian corresponds to the solid angle for which \\(A = r^2\\), thus 1 sr = 1.\"\n\nThe steradian is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 1st Edition as a supplementary SI unit.\nAt the 20th CGPM meeting in 1995, resolution 8 the categorization was changed to a dimensionless derived SI unit.",
