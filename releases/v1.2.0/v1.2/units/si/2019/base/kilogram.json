It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant \\(h\\) to be 6.62607015\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 when expressed in the unit J\u22c5s, which is equal to kg\u22c5m\u00b2\u22c5s\u207b\u00b9, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(\\Delta \\nu_\\textrm{Cs}\\).\" [26th CGPM Meeting (2018), resolution 1].\n\nThis definition references:\n\n- The 2019 SI derived joule unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/2019/named/joule).\n- The 1967 SI base second unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1967/base/second).",
