(1970) states: \"1 b = 100 fm\u00b2 = 10\u207b\u00b2\u2078 m\" with a footnote \"The barn is a special unit used in nuclear physics to express cross sections.\"\n\n- The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as \"Units in use temporarily with the International System.\"\n- The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) categorizes the unit as \"Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System.\"\n- The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the unit as \"Other non-SI units.\"",
