    "description": "A unit of acceleration equal to 1 centimeter per second squared (1 cm/s\u00b2), defined according to the 1967 SI units.\n\nThe gal appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as \"1 Gal = 1 cm/s\u00b2 = 10\u207b\u00b2 m/s\u00b2\" with the footnote \"The gal is a special unit of acceleration employed in geodesy and geophysics to express acceleration due to gravity.\"\n\n- The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as \"units in use temporarily\".\n- The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorisation to \"derived CGS units with special names\".\n- The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) moves the unit definition to the margin aside the table for Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI units.\n  It is not clear how to interprete the categorization intended with this placement of the unit.",
