The sievert is equal to the joule per kilogram.\" [16th CGPM meeting (1979), resolution 5]\n\nThe sievert was defined at the 16th CGPM meeting in 1979 and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the meter at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
