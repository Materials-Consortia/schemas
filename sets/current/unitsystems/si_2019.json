The phase angle (often just referred to as the \u201cphase\u201d) is the argument of any complex number. It is the angle between the positive real axis and the radius of the polar representation of the complex number in the complex plane. One radian corresponds to the angle for which \\(s = r\\), thus 1 rad = 1.
