The steradian is the solid angle with its vertex at the center of a sphere with a radius of one meter, which cuts out an area of one square meter on the surface of that sphere.\"\n\nThe International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition give a rephrased but equivalent definition: \"The solid angle, expressed in steradian, corresponds to the ratio between an area \\(A\\) of the surface of a sphere of radius \\(r\\) and the squared radius, \\(\\Omega = A/r^2\\) sr. One steradian corresponds to the solid angle for which \\(A = r^2\\), thus 1 sr = 1.\"\n\nThe steradian is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 1st Edition as a supplementary SI unit.\nAt the 20th CGPM meeting in 1995, resolution 8 the categorization was changed to a dimensionless derived SI unit.",
