(1998) in a footnote to a table labeled \"Non-SI units accepted for use with the International System, whose values in SI units are obtained experimentally\" in the section \"Units outside the international system\".\nThe definition given is: \"The unified atomic mass unit is equal to 1/12 of the mass of an unbound atom of the nuclide \u00b9\u00b2C, at rest, and in its ground state. In the field of biochemistry, the unified atomic mass unit is also called the dalton, symbol Da.\"\n\nThis definition makes the dalton equivalent to the atomic mass unit defined in The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2.0/si/general/atomicmassunit)\n\nIn the The International System of Units (SI) 8th ed.

(2019) has a longer but equivalent definition: \"The plane angle, expressed in radian, between two lines originating from a common point is the length of circular arc \\(s\\), swept out between the lines by a radius vector of length \\(r\\) from the common point divided by the length of the radius vector, \\(\\theta\\) = \\(s/r\\) rad. The phase angle (often just referred to as the \u201cphase\u201d) is the argument of any complex number. It is the angle between the positive real axis and the radius of the polar representation of the complex number in the complex plane. One radian corresponds to the angle for which \\(s = r\\), thus 1 rad = 1. The measure of the right angle is exactly equal to the number \u03c0/2.\"\n\nThe radian is categorized in the International System of Units (SI), 1st Edition as a supplementary SI unit.\nAt the 20th CGPM meeting in 1995, resolution 8 the categorization was changed to a dimensionless derived SI unit.\n\nThis is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.\nThis definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.",
